About
The Java-based Ticket Management System streamlines the handling of trouble tickets. Users and administrators log in via a secure portal, 
which allows users to create, view, and close issues while administrators manage and monitor all tickets. The system connects to a MySQL database and performs 
CRUD operations on tickets.
